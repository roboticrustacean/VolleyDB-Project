# VolleyDB-Project
 Volleyball database project for CMPE321 course. Developed using Django. 

# Introduction
Last year, our national volleyball team, which became the European champion
on the 100th anniversary of the Republic of T¨urkiye, made us all proud. Of course,
the best team in the world cannot stay away from technological developments and
must systematically manage its players’ data. A well-designed database system is
essential to ensure the reliability, consistency, and security of such systems. Turkish
Volleyball Federation needs your help with this database design!
This project aims to develop a database application for the VolleyDB design.
